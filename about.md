    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of camera traps surveys have been carried out over the last decade with the goal of estimating jaguar densities. Several recent publications have used results of those surveys to evaluate study designs, estimate range-wide jaguar numbers, habitat suitability and connectivity. However, published densities have inherent issues that make them difficult to integrate and compare (e.g. different methods were used to estimate density, sparse data results in very imprecise estimates, important metadata on the dataset was not published). We are interested in addressing these issues by compiling the raw jaguar camera trap datasets and analyzing them jointly using spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models. We believe that by jointly analyzing a large number of datasets we can not only obtain more accurate estimates for each individual site by sharing some parameters across datasets, we will also be able to tackle important questions such as differences in home-range size or density as a function of environmental and anthropogenic parameters. We are prepared to work with the people who collected the data on collaborative understanding of large scape patterns using state of the art SCR modelling.  This is an opportunity to combine forces, in a CRC framework to ask and examine key questions using jaguar camera trap data, in much the same way as has already been done by <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.2379">Morato et al.</a> using GPS telemetry data.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if we get enough datasets covering the full range of the jaguar, we can make much more precise predictions of jaguar numbers in different habitats. We envision several impactful publications coming out of the compiled datasets. All contributors will be included as co-authors on publications resulting from these compiled data. 
In addition to density estimates we are working with researchers at WildMe (<a href="http://www.wildbook.org">http://www.wildbook.org</a>) to train machine learning models that will be able to automatically identify individual jaguars from camera trap images with the goal of making the resulting models available to researchers (see prototype here <a href="https://jaguar.wildbook.org">https://jaguar.wildbook.org</a>) . If you are able to share the images associated with your dataset that would greatly help us to improve the accuracy of the models.</p>
